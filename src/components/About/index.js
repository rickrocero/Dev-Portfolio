                    <p> 
                        I'm a Certified Full-Stack Developer based in beautiful Bellingham,
                        Washington. Each day I bring my persistant desire to learn, passion
                        for coding, and the goal to improve the well-being of others through my work. I focus on a mobile-responsive 
                        frontend design, a robust backend, and a scalabale database.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                        I've earned a B.S. degree in cell &#38; molecular biology from Western 
                        Washington University. During my senior year I worked on data analysis and
                        visualization using R and I realized my deep appreciation for 
                        programming. I pivoted from medicine and carved a 
                        new path as a programmer.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p> 
                        Collaborative teamwork. Creative problem-solving.  
                        Improving the lives of the customers. These are skills I've honed as a STEM 
                        major, healthcare provider, and now as a developer. There is still
                        more for me to learn and that's truly exciting. I'd like to join a company
                        where I can grow professionally and personally while working alongside
                        ambitious people to deliver high-quality, innovative products.
