                    <p>I'm a certified full-stack developer based in beautiful Bellingham,
                        Washington. Each day I bring my persistant desire to learn, passion
                        for coding, and the goal of improving the well-being of others through
                        my work, to engineer captivating web applications. I focus on a mobile-responsive 
                        frontend design alongside a robust backend and a scalabale database.

                        <br/>
                        I've earned a B.S. degree in cell &#38; molecular biology from Western 
                        Washington University. During my senior year I worked on data analysis and
                        visualization using R and it is when I realized my deep appreciation for 
                        programming. I decided to not pursue medical school and carved a 
                        new path for myself in the tech industry as a programmer.

                        Working collaboratively. Creativity and critical thinking. Problem solving.  
                        Improving the lives of your customers. These are skills I've honed as a STEM 
                        major, healthcare provider, and now as a developer. There is still
                        more for me to learn and that's truly exciting. I'd like to join a company
                        where I can grow professionally and personally while working alongside other 
                        ambitious people to deliver high-quality, innovative products.
